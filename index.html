									<p>To celebrate our anniversary, I wanted to find something special, one of a kind. Because you are that to me. I looked everywhere, but nothing seemed quite right.</br> I settled on home. With mac and cheese. I thought it'd be an unexpected surprise. It seemed like the perfect fit, just like you are for me. </p>

									<p>It's been 31 million seconds together. Thank you for the year. The memories. The growth. The time together. Thank you for coming on this journey with me and inviting me to be a part of yours.</br> I'm looking forward to many more.</p>
